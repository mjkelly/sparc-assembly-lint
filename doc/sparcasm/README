This is a SPARC V8 assembler for NetBSD/sparc 1.1.  It is a standard, two-pass
assembler based on a yacc LALR(1) grammar, and a lex tokenizer.  The assembler
does most of the same things that the old SunOS 4.1.x assembler does, and all
the things that the GNU assembler does that are used in the assembly language
parts of the NetBSD kernel.
