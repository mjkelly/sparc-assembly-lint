Errors to catch:
- no save instruction
- no ret/restore
- suspicious save offsets
- no nop in delay slot
- mention broken gcc behavior on labels without leading .L?
- no label with same name as filename
- check for correct .section (.data for .word, etc, .section for instrs)
- check for .global
- set (or other multi-instruction pseudo-ops) in delay slot
- branch in delay slot (works, but undefined)
- label in delay slot? (valid, but in how many cases is it intended?)
- SAVE OFFSETS! SAVE OFFSETS! SAVE OFFSETS!
- Check alignment...
  This works:
	fmt: .asciz "x = %x\n"
	.align 4
	x: .word 5
  This doesn't:
	.align 4
	fmt: .asciz "x = %x\n"
	x: .word 5
  .aligns are tricky!
