Errors to catch:
- no save instruction
- no ret/restore
- no nop in delay slot
- mention broken gcc behavior on labels without leading .L?
- no label with same name as filename
- check for correct .section (.data for .word, etc, .section for instrs)
- check for .global
- reserve sudo-op
- A section is declared
- Check alignment...
  This works:
	fmt: .asciz "x = %x\n"
	.align 4
	x: .word 5
  This doesn't:
	.align 4
	fmt: .asciz "x = %x\n"
	x: .word 5
  .aligns are tricky!
