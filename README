Errors to catch:
- no save instruction
- no ret/restore
- suspicious save offsets
- no nop in delay slot
- strange registers (including %lo)
- mention broken gcc behavior on labels without leading .L?
- no label with same name as filename
- check alignment
- check for correct .section
- check for .global
- set (or other multi-instruction pseudo-ops) in delay slot
- branch in delay slot (works, but undefined)
- label in delay slot? (valid, but in how many cases is it intended?)
- resolve all assembly constants
- not %l0, %i2, %l0 <-- SEGFAULT on gcc
- SAVE OFFSETS! SAVE OFFSETS! SAVE OFFSETS!
- bogus .section names (make sure to catch .section ."text")

TODO:
Work on macro support; particularly exotic argument formats.
Opcodes that are commented out
