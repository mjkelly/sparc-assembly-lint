Errors to catch:
- no save instruction
- no ret/restore
- suspicious save offsets
- no nop in delay slot
- strange registers (including %lo)
- mention broken gcc behavior on labels without leading .L?
- no label with same name as filename
- check alignment
- check for correct .section
- check for .global
- set (or other multi-instruction pseudo-ops) in delay slot
- branch in delay slot (works, but undefined)
- label in delay slot? (valid, but in how many cases is it intended?)
